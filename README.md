# d2xl cIOS

This is a fork of davebaol's d2x-cIOS for Wii and WiiU, which I (Leseratte) named "d2xl-cIOS". 
The main goal was to make the cIOS compatible with the Wii Mini (which I accomplished using a 
hex editor). Now that I finally fixed the compiler issues and can properly compile the source 
code as of February 15th, 2020; I am planning to add more features to the cIOS as well.

#### DESCRIPTION

  This is a custom IOS for the Wii console, i.e. an IOS modified to add some new features
  not available in the official IOS.

  The d2xl cIOS is an enhanced version of the d2x cIOS, which is based on
  the cIOSX rev21 by Waninkoko. To see what's new read the file 
  Changelog.txt or visit the d2xl github project: https://github.com/Leseratte10/d2xl-cios

  the original idea to replace the buggy EHCI module of cIOSX rev21 with the
  working one from rev19.
